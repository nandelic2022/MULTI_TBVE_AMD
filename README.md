The material available on this repository contains the results and suplementary materials for
article currently under review process for the article entitled: 
Application of Symbolic Classifiers and Multi-Ensemble Threshold Techniques for Android Malware Detection
The material contains the best symbolic expressions obtained using GPSC with following dataset variations: 
1. Dataset with 241 input variables (all input variables)
2. Dataset with reduced number of input variables using Random Forest Classifier
3. Dataset with reduced number of input variables using Principal Component Analysis
Since the results of statistical analysis on dataset with all input variables is to large to placed in the manuscript this repository also
contains the pdf with table in which minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and mean value for all dataset varaibles is presented.
